Tested and reported to be working on: MacOS Linux Requires a JDK installation, tested with 1.8 so should work for any JDK with higher version number. Motivation The Tech Radar is a tool popularized by Thoughtworks's Technology radar. This implementation is based on the Zalando Technology radar. Thoughtworks provides an online tool to Building Your Own Tech Radar from a CSV file. You can also run this tool locally using a Docker container. This requires the container to be running to which you need to submit a CSV from an HTML end-point. All these can be combined into script to generate the Radar locally, but I was looking for something more light-weight. Main features: Run locally from the command line Run from a text file that can be put under source control Generate static HTML. Usage Download the latest release from releases . Via curl: Note: for the latest version you may want to check the releases link above. curl -LO https://github.com/lhohan/tech-radar/releases/download/v0.2.0/techradar && chmod +x techradar && ./techradar You should see output similar to: Error: Missing option --source CSV to Radar 0.2.0 Usage: CSV to Radar [options] In short techradar -s example.csv -t out/ -p index_template.html Step-by-step Copy following text to example.csv name,ring,quadrant,moved,description Decision records,adopt,techniques,none,\"...\" Domain Driven Design,trial,techniques,up,\"...\" Property-based testing,trial,techniques,down,\"...\" Scala,adopt,languages and frameworks,none,\"...\" TypeScript,adopt,languages and frameworks,none,\"...\" Run without template specified: techradar -s example.csv -t out/ or download the example template, which you probably will want to do anyway, so you can customize: https://github.com/lhohan/tech-radar/blob/main/src/main/resources/index_template.html In this case run: techradar -s example.csv -t out/ -p index_template.html modifying paths on where you saved the example files and where you want to write the output to.
