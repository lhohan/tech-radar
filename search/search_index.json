Motivation The Tech Radar is a tool popularized by Thoughtworks's Technology radar. This implementation is based on the Zalando Technology radar. Thoughtworks provides an online tool to Building Your Own Tech Radar from a CSV file. You can also run this tool locally using a Docker container. This requires the container to be running to which you need to provide a CSV from an HTML end-point and have the docker container permanently running. All these can be combined to script to generate the Radar locally as well, but I was looking for something more light-weight. Main features: Run locally from the command line Run from a text file that can be put under source control Generate static HTML. Usage Note: this has only been tested in MacOS.
